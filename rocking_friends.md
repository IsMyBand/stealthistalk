Rocking friends directory
============================

From time to time, I'd like to take a look to this book,... 
just to friendly manage memory of some friends around all 
this staff of running code over Linux.

Just to have some kind of [zero point](https://www.uv.es/ivorra/Historia/Cero.htm) right here, close to us, to 
[bootstrap](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28inform%C3%A1tica%29)!

Beyond Kernel, there is [some kind of energy running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics),
let's call it [execution time](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivel_de_ejecuci%C3%B3n). 

How ever, we should not confuse [computering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP2) with [biologics](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gametogeneza). Nothing to say.

So, for example:

Init
-----------------
[wiki](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init)

<blockquote>
Just after Big Bang, everything starts. As a matter of god, fiat lux!, INIT comes to light!
what ever: all in all, is comming through timeline and evolution over hardware, behind user interaction.
</blockquote>

INIT is a daemon, [desambiguation is needed](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzbel_%28desambiguaci%C3%B3n%29) with such a term. You know, PID 1. He is the alpha and the omega, I should say: 

```
 And old /etc/rc, followed by /etc/rc.d starting stoping services.
 ```
 
 Four rings when monolític kernel like [Atón-Ra](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/At%C3%B3n) and also, however, nertheless, 
 hibrid while [four rings](https://www.google.es/search?q=linux+four+rings) are projected ahead from hardware towards user GUI.
